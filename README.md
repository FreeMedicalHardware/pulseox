Pulse Oximeter
==============

This project aims to create a research-validated pulse oximeter whose plans are available freely and openly. The goal is for the device to cost under USD$25 to produce.

Currently, **THE PULSE OXIMETER IS NOT USABLE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN A CLINICAL SETTING.** The current version can be used for laboratory testing only.


Status
======
The device is undergoing clinical calibration as of 2019 OCTOBER 2.
