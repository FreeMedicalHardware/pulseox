Pulse Oximeter
==============

This project aims to create a research-validated pulse oximeter whose plans are available freely and openly. The goal is for the device to cost under USD$25 to produce.

Currently, the pulse oximeter is not yet usable and should not be used in a clinical setting. The current version can be used for laboratory testing only.
